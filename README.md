[KITTI Vision benchmark Suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Geiger2012CVPR.pdf)
3D visual odometer / SLAM

Sensors and Data Acquisition

Sensor Calibration

Camera to Camera Calibration

Ground truth and optical-flow

Object detection

[KITTI raw data](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php)

Visual localization

KITTI to ROSbag tool

What is ROSbag how do you use that with self driving

Requirements

Using the given data, competitors must:

1. automatically detect and locate obstacles in 3D space to inform the driver/SDC system (e.g. using deep learning and classification approaches)

2. Fuse detection output from camera and LIDAR sensors

3. Remove noise and environment false detections

## Evaluation and judging criteria

PASCAL criteria for object detection and orientation estimation performance

Moderate evaluation parameters for ranking
